# mood_based_recommender
A recommender system which finds content based on what you are in the mood to watch.

## Goal
Most recommender systems do not take into account what mood you are in when finding content for you. You may like Rush Hour, but are you in the mood for a comedy right now? The goal of this project is to build an app that allows users to easily find content that they are in the mood for right now. Users can either select films they've already seen which are similar to what they want to watch, or they can select a set of descriptions. The recommender will return a list of content as well as some keywords describing why it is close to what they are in the mood for.

## Objectives
1. Create a content based recommender
2. Incorporate reviews to create descriptions of the films
